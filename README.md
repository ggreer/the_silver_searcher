# The Silver Searcher - Incremental manual transpilation to Rust

Hi there!

First of all, thank you for your work on this beautiful tool and for sharing it for free!

About this pull request:
As part of my Bachelor thesis in Computer Science at the Technische UniversitÃ¤t Darmstadt, I forumlated a "recipe" to do manual and incremental C to Rust transpilation and applied it on your project's filter and ignore functionalities.
Of course it would be great if you considered merging this pull request or branching off in your repository, but apart from that even some sort of smallish feedback would mean a lot coming from you and may substanciate further work on this topic.
For about 5 months, I will keep working on this with my thesis' supervisor, and, if everything works out, we will publish a paper - so thank you very much if you should find the time to contribute and help me pacing forward in this direction!

Best
Phil


# The Silver Searcher

A code searching tool similar to `ack`, with a focus on speed.

Do you know C? Want to improve ag? [I invite you to pair with me](http://geoff.greer.fm/2014/10/13/help-me-get-to-ag-10/).


## What's so great about Ag?

* It is an order of magnitude faster than `ack`.
* It ignores file patterns from your `.gitignore` and `.hgignore`.
* If there are files in your source repo you don't want to search, just add their patterns to a `.ignore` file. (\*cough\* `*.min.js` \*cough\*)
* The command name is 33% shorter than `ack`, and all keys are on the home row!

Ag is quite stable now. Most changes are new features, minor bug fixes, or performance improvements. It's much faster than Ack in my benchmarks:

    ack test_blah ~/code/  104.66s user 4.82s system 99% cpu 1:50.03 total

    ag test_blah ~/code/  4.67s user 4.58s system 286% cpu 3.227 total

Ack and Ag found the same results, but Ag was 34x faster (3.2 seconds vs 110 seconds). My `~/code` directory is about 8GB. Thanks to git/hg/ignore, Ag only searched 700MB of that.

There are also [graphs of performance across releases](http://geoff.greer.fm/ag/speed/).

## How is it so fast?

* Ag uses [Pthreads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX_Threads) to take advantage of multiple CPU cores and search files in parallel.
* Files are `mmap()`ed instead of read into a buffer.
* Literal string searching uses [Boyer-Moore strstr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore_string_search_algorithm).
* Regex searching uses [PCRE's JIT compiler](http://sljit.sourceforge.net/pcre.html) (if Ag is built with PCRE >=8.21).
* Ag calls `pcre_study()` before executing the same regex on every file.
* Instead of calling `fnmatch()` on every pattern in your ignore files, non-regex patterns are loaded into arrays and binary searched.

I've written several blog posts showing how I've improved performance. These include how I [added pthreads](http://geoff.greer.fm/2012/09/07/the-silver-searcher-adding-pthreads/), [wrote my own `scandir()`](http://geoff.greer.fm/2012/09/03/profiling-ag-writing-my-own-scandir/), [benchmarked every revision to find performance regressions](http://geoff.greer.fm/2012/08/25/the-silver-searcher-benchmarking-revisions/), and profiled with [gprof](http://geoff.greer.fm/2012/02/08/profiling-with-gprof/) and [Valgrind](http://geoff.greer.fm/2012/01/23/making-programs-faster-profiling/).

        pkg_add the_silver_searcher

### Windows

* Win32/64

  Unofficial daily builds are [available](https://github.com/k-takata/the_silver_searcher-win32).
  
* winget

        winget install "The Silver Searcher"
  
  Notes:
  - This installs a [release](https://github.com/JFLarvoire/the_silver_searcher/releases) of ag.exe optimized for Windows.
  - winget is intended to become the default package manager client for Windows.  
    As of June 2020, it's still in beta, and can be installed using instructions [there](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli).
  - The setup script in the Ag's winget package installs ag.exe in the first directory that matches one of these criteria:
     1. Over a previous instance of ag.exe *from the same [origin](https://github.com/JFLarvoire/the_silver_searcher)* found in the PATH
     2. In the directory defined in environment variable bindir_%PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE%
     3. In the directory defined in environment variable bindir
     4. In the directory defined in environment variable windir
  
* Chocolatey

        choco install ag
* MSYS2

        pacman -S mingw-w64-{i686,x86_64}-ag
* Cygwin

  Run the relevant [`setup-*.exe`](https://cygwin.com/install.html), and select "the\_silver\_searcher" in the "Utils" category.

## Building from source

### Building master

1. Install dependencies (Automake, pkg-config, PCRE, LZMA):
    * macOS:

            brew install automake pkg-config pcre xz
        or

            port install automake pkgconfig pcre xz
    * Ubuntu/Debian:

            apt-get install -y automake pkg-config libpcre3-dev zlib1g-dev liblzma-dev
    * Fedora:

            yum -y install pkgconfig automake gcc zlib-devel pcre-devel xz-devel
    * CentOS:

            yum -y groupinstall "Development Tools"
            yum -y install pcre-devel xz-devel zlib-devel
    * openSUSE:

            zypper source-install --build-deps-only the_silver_searcher

    * Windows: It's complicated. See [this wiki page](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher/wiki/Windows).
2. Run the build script (which just runs aclocal, automake, etc):

        ./build.sh

   On Windows (inside an msys/MinGW shell):

        make -f Makefile.w32
3. Make install:

        sudo make install


### Building a release tarball

GPG-signed releases are available [here](http://geoff.greer.fm/ag).

Building release tarballs requires the same dependencies, except for automake and pkg-config. Once you've installed the dependencies, just run:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

You may need to use `sudo` or run as root for the make install.


## Editor Integration

### Vim

You can use Ag with [ack.vim](https://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim) by adding the following line to your `.vimrc`:

    let g:ackprg = 'ag --nogroup --nocolor --column'

or:

    let g:ackprg = 'ag --vimgrep'

Which has the same effect but will report every match on the line.

### Emacs

You can use [ag.el][] as an Emacs front-end to Ag. See also: [helm-ag].

[ag.el]: https://github.com/Wilfred/ag.el
[helm-ag]: https://github.com/syohex/emacs-helm-ag

### TextMate

TextMate users can use Ag with [my fork](https://github.com/ggreer/AckMate) of the popular AckMate plugin, which lets you use both Ack and Ag for searching. If you already have AckMate you just want to replace Ack with Ag, move or delete `"~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/PlugIns/AckMate.tmplugin/Contents/Resources/ackmate_ack"` and run `ln -s /usr/local/bin/ag "~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/PlugIns/AckMate.tmplugin/Contents/Resources/ackmate_ack"`

## Other stuff you might like

* [Ack](https://github.com/petdance/ack3) - Better than grep. Without Ack, Ag would not exist.
* [ack.vim](https://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim)
* [Exuberant Ctags](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/) - Faster than Ag, but it builds an index beforehand. Good for *really* big codebases.
* [Git-grep](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-grep) - As fast as Ag but only works on git repos.
* [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) - A command-line fuzzy finder 
* [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
* [Sack](https://github.com/sampson-chen/sack) - A utility that wraps Ack and Ag. It removes a lot of repetition from searching and opening matching files.
