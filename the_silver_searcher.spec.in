The Silver Searcher
An attempt to make something better than ack (which itself is better than grep).

Why use Ag?
* It searches code about 3–5× faster than ack.
* It ignores file patterns from your .gitignore and .hgignore.
* If there are files in your source repo you don't want to search, just add their patterns to a .ignore file. *cough* extern *cough*
* The command name is 33% shorter than ack!

How is it so fast?
* Searching for literals (no regex) uses Boyer-Moore-Horspool strstr.
* Files are mmap()ed instead of read into a buffer.
* If you're building with PCRE 8.21 or greater, regex searches use the JIT compiler.
* Ag calls pcre_study() before executing the regex on a jillion files.
* Instead of calling fnmatch() on every pattern in your ignore files, non-regex patterns are loaded into an array and binary searched.
* Ag uses Pthreads to take advantage of multiple CPU cores and search files in parallel.
