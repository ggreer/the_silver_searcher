/*
 * ------------------------------------------------------
 * DOCPUBLIC
 *      This function waits on a semaphore possibly until
 *      'abstime' time.
 *
 * PARAMETERS
 *      sem
 *              pointer to an instance of sem_t
 *
 *      abstime
 *              pointer to an instance of struct timespec
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *      This function waits on a semaphore. If the
 *      semaphore value is greater than zero, it decreases
 *      its value by one. If the semaphore value is zero, then
 *      the calling thread (or process) is blocked until it can
 *      successfully decrease the value or until interrupted by
 *      a signal.
 *
 *      If 'abstime' is a NULL pointer then this function will
 *      block until it can successfully decrease the value or
 *      until interrupted by a signal.
 *
 * RESULTS
 *              0               successfully decreased semaphore,
 *              -1              failed, error in errno
 * ERRNO
 *              EINVAL          'sem' is not a valid semaphore,
 *              ENOSYS          semaphores are not supported,
 *              EINTR           the function was interrupted by a signal,
 *              EDEADLK         a deadlock condition was detected.
 *              ETIMEDOUT       abstime elapsed before success.
