                   Things that aren't done yet
                   ---------------------------

1. Implement PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED for semaphores, mutexes,
   condition variables, read/write locks, barriers.
   
   IMO, to do this in a source code compatible way requires implementation of
   POSIX shared memory functions, etc.

2. For version 3 onwards: the following types need to change, resulting in an ABI
   change. These have been written conditional on PTW32_VERSION_MAJOR > 2

   a) ptw32_handle_t (a.k.a. pthread_t)
   Change the reuse counter from unsigned int to size_t. Type "int" on 32 bit
   and 64 bit Windows is 32 bits wide.
   
   To give an indication of relative effectiveness of the current "unsigned int",
   consider an application that creates and detaches a single thread every 
   millisecond. At this rate the reuse counter will max out after 49 days.

   After changing to "size_t" an application compiled for x64 and creating and
   detaching a single thread every nanosecond would max out after 584 years.

   b) pthread_once_t
   Remove elements no longer required after switching to use of MCS lock.
