      * ------------------------------------------------------
      * DOCPUBLIC
      *      This function waits for 'thread' to terminate and
      *      returns the thread's exit value if 'value_ptr' is not
      *      NULL. This also detaches the thread on successful
      *      completion.
      *
      * PARAMETERS
      *      thread
      *              an instance of pthread_t
      *
      *      value_ptr
      *              pointer to an instance of pointer to void
      *
      *
      * DESCRIPTION
      *      This function waits for 'thread' to terminate and
      *      returns the thread's exit value if 'value_ptr' is not
      *      NULL. This also detaches the thread on successful
      *      completion.
      *      NOTE:   detached threads cannot be joined or canceled
      *
      * RESULTS
      *              0               'thread' has completed
      *              EINVAL          thread is not a joinable thread,
      *              ESRCH           no thread could be found with ID 'thread',
      *              ENOENT          thread couldn't find it's own valid handle,
      *              EDEADLK         attempt to join thread with self
