int
ptw32_semwait (sem_t * sem)
/*
 * ------------------------------------------------------
 * DESCRIPTION
 *      This function waits on a POSIX semaphore. If the
 *      semaphore value is greater than zero, it decreases
 *      its value by one. If the semaphore value is zero, then
 *      the calling thread (or process) is blocked until it can
 *      successfully decrease the value.
 *
 *      Unlike sem_wait(), this routine is non-cancelable.
 *
 * RESULTS
 *              0               successfully decreased semaphore,
 *              -1              failed, error in errno.
 * ERRNO
 *              EINVAL          'sem' is not a valid semaphore,
 *              ENOSYS          semaphores are not supported,
 *              EINTR           the function was interrupted by a signal,
 *              EDEADLK         a deadlock condition was detected.
