/*

 * DOCPUBLIC
 *      This function tries to wait on a semaphore.
 *
 * PARAMETERS
 *      sem
 *              pointer to an instance of sem_t
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *      This function tries to wait on a semaphore. If the
 *      semaphore value is greater than zero, it decreases
 *      its value by one. If the semaphore value is zero, then
 *      this function returns immediately with the error EAGAIN
 *
 * RESULTS
 *              0               successfully decreased semaphore,
 *              -1              failed, error in errno
 * ERRNO
 *              EAGAIN          the semaphore was already locked,
 *              EINVAL          'sem' is not a valid semaphore,
 *              ENOTSUP         sem_trywait is not supported,
 *              EINTR           the function was interrupted by a signal,
 *              EDEADLK         a deadlock condition was detected.
