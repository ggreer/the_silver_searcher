 * __ptw32_getprocessors()

 * Get the number of CPUs available to the process.
 *
 * If the available number of CPUs is 1 then pthread_spin_lock()
 * will block rather than spin if the lock is already owned.
 *
 * pthread_spin_init() calls this routine when initialising
 * a spinlock. If the number of available processors changes
 * (after a call to SetProcessAffinityMask()) then only
 * newly initialised spinlocks will notice.
