      * ------------------------------------------------------
      * DOCPUBLIC
      *      This function specifies the size of the stack on
      *      which threads created with 'attr' will run.
      *
      * PARAMETERS
      *      attr
      *              pointer to an instance of pthread_attr_t
      *
      *      stacksize
      *              stack size, in bytes.
      *
      *
      * DESCRIPTION
      *      This function specifies the size of the stack on
      *      which threads created with 'attr' will run.
      *
      *      NOTES:
      *              1)      Function supported only if this macro is
      *                      defined:
      *
      *                              _POSIX_THREAD_ATTR_STACKSIZE
      *
      *              2)      Find the default first (using
      *                      pthread_attr_getstacksize), then increase
      *                      by multiplying.
      *
      *              3)      Only use if thread needs more than the
      *                      default.
      *
      * RESULTS
      *              0               successfully set stack size,
      *              EINVAL          'attr' is invalid or stacksize too
      *                              small or too big.
      *              ENOSYS          function not supported
