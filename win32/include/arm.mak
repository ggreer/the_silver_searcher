#   File name:	    arm.mak						      #
#									      #
#   Description:    A NMake makefile to build ARM programs.		      #
#									      #
#   Notes:	    Use with make.bat, which defines the necessary variables. #
#		    Usage: make -f arm.mak [definitions] [targets]	      #
#		    							      #
#		    Targets:						      #
#		    clean	      Erase all files in ARM subdirectory.    #
#		    {prog}.exe	      Build ARM[\DEBUG]\{prog}.exe.	      #
#		    {prog}.obj	      Build ARM[\DEBUG]\OBJ\{prog}.obj.       #
#		    {prog}.res	      Build ARM[\DEBUG]\OBJ\{prog}.res.       #
#		    ARM\{prog}.exe       Build the ARM release version.       #
#		    ARM\DEBUG\{prog}.exe Build the ARM debug version.         #
#		    ARM\OBJ\{prog}.obj       Compile the release version.     #
#		    ARM\DEBUG\OBJ\{prog}.obj Compile the debug version.       #
#		    ARM\OBJ\{prog}.res       Compile release resources.       #
#		    ARM\DEBUG\OBJ\{prog}.res Compile debug resources.	      #
#									      #
#		    Command-line definitions:				      #
#		    DEBUG=0	 Build the release ver. (<=> target ARM)      #
#		    DEBUG=1	 Build the debug ver. (<=> target ARM\DEBUG)  #
#		    PROGRAM=name Set the output file base name		      #
#									      #
#		    If a specific target [path\]{prog}.exe is specified,      #
#		    includes the corresponding {prog}.mak if it exists.       #
#		    This make file, defines the files to use beyond the       #
#		    default {prog}.c/{prog}.obj; Compiler options; etc.       #
#		    SOURCES	Source files to compile.		      #
#		    OBJECTS	Object files to link. Optional.		      #
#		    PROGRAM	The node name of the program to build. Opt.   #
#		    EXENAME	The file name of the program to build. Opt.   #
#		    SKIP_THIS	Message explaining why NOT to build. Opt.     #
#									      #
#		    In the absence of a {prog}.mak file, or if one of the     #
#		    generic targets is used, then the default Files.mak is    #
#		    used instead. Same definitions.			      #
#									      #
#		    Note that these sub-make files are designed to be	      #
#		    OS-independant. The goal is to reuse them to build	      #
#		    the same program under Unix/Linux too. So for example,    #
#		    all paths must contain forward slashes.		      #
#									      #
#		    Another design goal is to use that same arm.mak	      #
#		    in complex 1-project environments (One Files.mak defines  #
#		    all project components); And in simple multiple-project   #
#		    environments (No Files.mak; Most programs have a single   #
#		    source file, and use default compiler options).	      #
#									      #
#		    The following macros / environment variables must be      #
#		    predefined. This allows to use the same makefile on       #
#		    machines with various locations for the build tools.      #
#									      #
#		    ARM_AS	    	32-bits ARM Assembler		      #
#		    ARM_CC    		32-bits ARM C compiler		      #
#		    ARM_INCPATH  	32-bits ARM include files paths	      #
#		    ARM_LK	  	32-bits ARM Linker		      #
#		    ARM_LIBPATH		32-bits ARM libraries paths	      #
#		    ARM_LB	   	32-bits ARM librarian     	      #
#		    ARM_PATH  		32-bits ARM programs paths	      #
#		    ARM_RC    		32-bits Resource compiler	      #
#		    ARM_MT    		32-bits Manifest Tool		      #
#		    TMP		    	Temporary directory	 	      #
