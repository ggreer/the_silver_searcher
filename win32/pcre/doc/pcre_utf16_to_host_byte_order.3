.SH DESCRIPTION
.rs
.sp
This function, which exists only in the 16-bit library, converts a UTF-16
string to the correct order for the current host, taking account of any byte
order marks (BOMs) within the string. Its arguments are:
.sp
  \fIoutput\fP           pointer to output buffer, may be the same as \fIinput\fP
  \fIinput\fP            pointer to input buffer
  \fIlength\fP           number of 16-bit units in the input, or negative for
                     a zero-terminated string
  \fIhost_byte_order\fP  a NULL value or a non-zero value pointed to means
                     start in host byte order
  \fIkeep_boms\fP        if non-zero, BOMs are copied to the output string
.sp
The result of the function is the number of 16-bit units placed into the output
buffer, including the zero terminator if the string was zero-terminated.
.P
If \fIhost_byte_order\fP is not NULL, it is set to indicate the byte order that
is current at the end of the string.
