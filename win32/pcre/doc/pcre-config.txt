PCRE-CONFIG(1)              General Commands Manual             PCRE-CONFIG(1)



NAME
       pcre-config - program to return PCRE configuration

SYNOPSIS

       pcre-config [--prefix] [--exec-prefix] [--version] [--libs]
                   [--libs16] [--libs32] [--libs-cpp] [--libs-posix]
                   [--cflags] [--cflags-posix]


DESCRIPTION

       pcre-config  returns  the configuration of the installed PCRE libraries
       and the options required to compile a program to use them. Some of  the
       options  apply  only  to the 8-bit, or 16-bit, or 32-bit libraries, re-
       spectively, and are not available if only one of  those  libraries  has
       been built. If an unavailable option is encountered, the "usage" infor-
       mation is output.


OPTIONS

       --prefix  Writes the directory prefix used in the PCRE installation for
                 architecture   independent   files  (/usr  on  many  systems,
                 /usr/local on some systems) to the standard output.

       --exec-prefix
                 Writes the directory prefix used in the PCRE installation for
                 architecture  dependent files (normally the same as --prefix)
                 to the standard output.

       --version Writes the version number of the installed PCRE libraries  to
                 the standard output.

       --libs    Writes  to  the  standard output the command line options re-
                 quired to link with the 8-bit PCRE library  (-lpcre  on  many
                 systems).

       --libs16  Writes  to  the  standard output the command line options re-
                 quired to link with the 16-bit PCRE library (-lpcre16 on many
                 systems).

       --libs32  Writes  to  the  standard output the command line options re-
                 quired to link with the 32-bit PCRE library (-lpcre32 on many
                 systems).

       --libs-cpp
                 Writes  to  the  standard output the command line options re-
                 quired to link with PCRE's  C++  wrapper  library  (-lpcrecpp
                 -lpcre on many systems).

       --libs-posix
                 Writes  to  the  standard output the command line options re-
                 quired  to  link  with  PCRE's  POSIX  API  wrapper   library
                 (-lpcreposix -lpcre on many systems).

       --cflags  Writes  to  the  standard output the command line options re-
                 quired to compile files that use PCRE (this may include  some
                 -I options, but is blank on many systems).

       --cflags-posix
                 Writes  to  the  standard output the command line options re-
                 quired to compile files that use PCRE's POSIX API wrapper li-
                 brary (this may include some -I options, but is blank on many
                 systems).
